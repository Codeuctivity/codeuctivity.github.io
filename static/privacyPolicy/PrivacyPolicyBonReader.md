# Privacy Policy

Effective Date: 2023-22-06

Thank you for choosing to use BonReader (referred to as "the App"). This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our App. We are committed to respecting your privacy and ensuring the confidentiality and security of any personal information you provide. Please read this policy carefully to understand our practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of your information.

1. Information Collection:

    We want to emphasize that our App does not collect any personal data or personally identifiable information from you. We designed the App to respect your privacy and to operate without the need for data collection.

2. Use of Information:

    Since we do not collect any personal data or personally identifiable information from you, we do not use your information for any purpose. 

3. Third-Party Services:

    Our App may contain links or integration to third-party services, websites, or applications. Please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to any third-party services or websites. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of those third parties before using their services or providing any personal information to them. The only third-party service used today is a service that resolves VAT numbers to obtain their human-readable names.

4. Children's Privacy:

    Our App is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe that we may have inadvertently collected personal information from a child under the age of 13, please contact us immediately, and we will take steps to delete that information.

5. Data Security:

    We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the security and integrity of any information you provide. However, please note that no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

6. Changes to the Privacy Policy:

    We reserve the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy at any time, and such changes will be effective immediately upon posting the revised policy on the App. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed about how we protect your privacy.

By using our App, you agree to the terms and conditions outlined in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, please do not use the App.
